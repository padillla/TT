- automate the build.  Jake or Grunt?

- test drive the whole thing. WIP
		>>set it on Grunt

- rewrite API for more sense on loading each trip.
		>> It will make a GET request including trip number and route ID
		>> Express will return a GeoJSON feature collection
		>> response has to be structured like this:
			Example 
			Request
				GET: http://localhost/route/1/5061123
			Response:
				{type: "Feature Collection",
					Features:[
						{Routeline},
						{stop},
						{stop},
						{stop},
						{stop},
						{stop}
					]
				}

- make a better layout, or make a badass interface in Angular.
   		>> add a button to go to top of page, or make it easy to go to top.

- make animated marker for train on the road.  Done.
		>> now make it work at realtime speed with a more appealing look.

- Make each marker to show a link to a detailed view of trains that will pass there. 	ONGOING

-make the moving train view boundaries to be the last and next stop.

-Change the tile layer. Cloud made will not longer be available after May 1ST
